# Finding Pairs

**Finding Pairs:** 
Finding pairs is a type of cognitive exercise designed to stimulate and challenge various cognitive functions, including perception, memory, problem-solving, decision-making, reasoning, attention, and language. It tests and enhances a player's memory and concentration skills. In a typical memory game, players use a set of face-down cards, taking turns to flip them over and find matching pairs. This classic Finding pairs game features cards with Fortnite characters. The inclusion of Fortnite characters in the game is primarily for aesthetic and engagement purposes. 

**Game Objective:**
The main objective of the memory game is to challenge and improve a player's memory and concentration skills by matching pairs of cards. The game typically consists of a set of face-down cards, and the primary goal is to find all the matching pairs within the set.
Here are the key objectives of a memory game:<br>
**Memory Enhancement:** The game aims to improve a player's memory by requiring them to remember the locations of various images or symbols on the cards and matching them. <br>
**Concentration:** Players need to maintain focus and concentration to track the positions of the cards they've flipped and identify matching pairs.<br>
**Cognitive Skills:** Memory games help exercise various cognitive functions, including short-term memory, attention, and pattern recognition.<br>
**Entertainment and Engagement:** Memory games are often designed with engaging themes and images to make the exercise more enjoyable and fun.<br>
**Challenge:** Players are challenged to complete the game with the fewest attempts and in the shortest time possible, adding an element of competition and motivation.<br>

**Game rules:**
The rules of the Finding pairs game are relatively simple and consistent across most versions of the game. Here are the typical game rules for a memory game:
- 1.Setup:
Lay out of 4*4 grid of face-down cards on a playing surface. There are 16 cards in total, with each card having a matching pair. The number of cards can vary, but they are usually arranged in rows and columns.
Each card has a matching pair. This means that there are two cards with the same image, symbol, or pattern on the playing surface.
- 2.Objective:
The main objective of the game is to find and match all the pairs of cards in the 4x4 grid. Each pair consists of two identical cards.
- 3.Gameplay:
Revealing Cards: On a player's turn, they can choose any two face-down cards to flip over, revealing the images on those cards. The player must specify which two cards they want to flip.
Matching Pairs: If the two revealed cards match (i.e., they have the same image or symbol), the player keeps the pair and gets another turn. Matching pairs are kept open to keep track.
Not Matching Pairs: If the two revealed cards do not match, then the cards face down again, and it becomes the next turn.
Memory and Concentration: The challenge of the game is to remember the positions of the cards that have been revealed previously. Players must use their memory and concentration to find matching pairs based on their observations.
- 4.Winning:
If number of turns <=12, it displays Incredible! You've got a great memory. You took (number of turns) tries to finish.
If number of turns >=12 and turns<16, it displays Great job! Keep it up!. You took (number of turns) tries to finish.
If number of turns >=16 and turns<20, it displays Good job!Keep trying!. You took (number of turns) tries to finish.  
If number of turns >20, it displays Iâ€™d check with a doctor if I were you. You took (number of turns) tries to finish. 
- 5.Variations and Additional rules:
To make this memory game more challenging, we thought of introducing variations and additional rules that test and enhance players' memory and concentration skills. 
Here are some ways to increase the challenge in a memory game:
Increase the Number of Cards: Introducing additional cards to expand the grid's dimensions enhances the cognitive demands on players, necessitating the retention of an increased number of card positions, thereby elevating the level of challenge. To intensify the intricacy of the game, we've opted for a 4*4 grid configuration, accommodating a total of 16 cards.
Decrease the Time Limit: Implement a time limit for each turn. Players must find and match pairs within a set time frame, which adds pressure and requires quicker thinking.
Limit the Number of Turns: Restrict each player to a specific number of turns. When players have a limited number of opportunities to flip cards, they need to make each turn count.

**Technologies:**
To enhance the visual presentation and interaction of web page elements, the code is primarily a React component written in JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. Technologies and libraries used outline the dependencies and devDependencies used in the "memory-game" project, including React and various tools and libraries for development, linting, and optimization. CSS is used in conjunction with various web development technologies and libraries to streamline development and create more complex, interactive web applications.
- 1. HTML: HTML is used to structure the content of a web page. It defines the elements (e.g., headings, paragraphs, buttons, App, Card grid, Confetti) and their organization on the page.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to control the presentation and styling of the HTML elements. We used CSS to style elements like buttons, images, and grids.
- 2. React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and managing components and states in the application. The entire component is built using React, making use of React features like functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect), and JSX for rendering
- 3. CSS: The component includes a reference to an external CSS file named "Score.css" to style its elements. The CSS styles are applied to control the visual presentation of the component.
- 4. JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. JavaScript is used to create interactive elements, handle user input, and respond to events like button clicks or form submissions.
- 5. Node.js: Node.js is the runtime environment used for executing JavaScript code on the server or in this project's build process.
- 6. GitHub Pages and GitHub repositories: We've leveraged GitHub repositories for collaborative coding and chosen GitHub Pages as our hosting solution. GitHub Pages excels in serving our static game directly from our repositories, streamlining development and deployment.
